# HomeFront

[See Live](https://homefront.app)

This is an Angular + Firebase app that is used in conjunction with my [BMS software](https://github.com/ztimson/HomeFront-Battery) to display and graph battery module's voltage & tempature for an offgrid solar system. It also provides weather the weather and I have future plans to add the TPLink Kasa & Philips Hue API's so I can also control the lights and power outlets in my automated house from one interface.
